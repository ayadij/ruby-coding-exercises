binary guessing game where cpu guesses your number from 1-25

it guesses you tell it higher or lower it adjusts its guess based on your input and creates a new smarter guess the computer should not guess the same number twice and it should be able to narrow its selection based on your input so that it wont go higher if you say to go lower etc

repeat until the computer guesses your number

bonus: record number of guesses ask player if they want to play again rememner sepration of concerns, and dividing things into separate methods as much sa it makes sense
